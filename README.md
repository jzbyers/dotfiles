## Alacritty + Tmux

One of my favorite features of Alacritty is its ability to send escape sequences 
in hexcode for custom keyboard shortcuts. This allows me to remap `tmux` 
keybindings to whatever I want, so instead of pressing `ctrl-f c` to create a 
tab, I can remap that to `cmd + t` (using a Mac keyboard here for example).

All of my keyboard shortcuts can be found in `alacritty.toml`.
